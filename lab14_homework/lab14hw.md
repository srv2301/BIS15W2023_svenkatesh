## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.


## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

For a data scientist, you would need atleast a bachelor's degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science or any other related field. Data Science is a growing field, scientists predict a 36% growth of employment of data scientists from 2021-2031.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Skills: R - tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, readr
Working with data matrices, vectors, data frame, mutating, summarising, pivoting data, ggplot, UI, Shinyapps

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

I am currently interested in computational biology and protein structure design. The skills I have learned from R would help me conduct DNA/amino acid sequence analyses, which is essential in the computational aspect of protein design.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?
In addition to the fast paced introduction to R itself, I found that certain concepts like pivoting & specific combination functions (ike group_by with summarise) were difficult for me to grasp. 

However, I have found that being able to work with any class and kind of dataset, as well as creating shinyapps and ggplots have been most rewarding for me.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I don't feel like I required any necessary skills prior to learning R, just as it is with any other language. However, I do wish that I had some basic background in another computer programming language like python or java, so that taking R would have been an asset to my existing coding skills.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

Definitely more UI and Shinyapps. Since taking this class, I have realized that I enjoy the front-end aspect of programming and the design part of apps. So I would have personally been interested to learn more about UI.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I do! I would love to minor in computer science or data science if my degree permits. Ideally, I would love to gain some industry experience in biotechnology, for which coding and a background in biology would be necessary. I would also love to pursue research in any capacity.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I think that collaborating with my partner made my learning of R so much better just because we were able to contribute and exchange differing ideas on similar problems and alot of the time I better understood something when seeing her version of a specific code. It was definitely integral to my learning in this class, and I think that if we were online I would likely not have been as inclined to collaborate on a project or be enthusiastic about learning to code itself!

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.
I have completed it!
